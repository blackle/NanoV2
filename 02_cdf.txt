Waystation 02
Orbcomm is a (now defunct) satellite communication network with [FILLMEIN] satellites operating in low earth orbit. One of them, Orbcomm-QL2, is by chance flying directly overhead tonight at [FILLMEIN]. Well, we had to move the imaging array about 40 meters south east from where we built it, and we'll need to move it back to image the anomaly, but other than that it's quite the stroke of luck.
The satellite is about 1.5 meters tall, and since low earth orbit is negligible compared to the radius of the earth this corresponds to a shadow that's 1.4 meters tall, a perfect size to test the array on.
